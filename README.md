# chrome-screenshot-extension
Chrome extension for creating screenshots for PlayStore and AppStore submissions.

Way to use the extension:
1) Turn on “Mobile emulation” in chrome.
2) Select the desired device, e.g., choose "iPhone 6".
3) Make sure it’s shown as 100% and the entire screen is visible. (If it doesn’t fit in your screen, maximize chrome, and if that's not enough, increase your screen resolution.)
4) Click on the camera icon to save the printscreen as a PNG image file in your ~/Downloads folder,
according to Apple's specs (e.g., iPhone4 as 640x960 png, iPhone6p as 1242x2208 png, etc).
